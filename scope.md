# Project Scope

After thinking about this project for a day or so, I think the initial six questions that I came up with are a good starting point.
#### Initial biiases
                I think it's a good idea to get what my assumptions will be out in the open. Being aware of what my biases are up front will help me control them,
		and also provide peers an opportunity to scrutinize my results more effictively

### 1) How does average bmi compare across the different regions? Where do the healthiest men and women live?
	#### Initial biiases
		- I think that women will have a lower bmi overall
		- I think that the bmi of the different regions will be as follows (ASC):
			1. Southwest
			2. Northwest
			3. Northeast
			4. Southeast
		- My reasoning behind this has two components, the first being economic and the second being cultural.
			-Economic
				Unfortunately, wealth is an excellent indicator of what an individual's overall health might be. The reasoning behind this is that auxilary income makes it easier to afford things that make it easier to make more healthful choices (having health insurance, seeing a primary care doctor regularly, and enrolling in a fitness program come to mind). While analyzing economic data is out of the scope of this project, a cursory search on Trulia provides anecdotal evidence that, based on real estate prices, the SW, NW and NE all have states with extremely high real estate prices, (California, Washington and New York, in particular), while the SE comparitively lacks any states well known for their high realty prices.
			-Cultural
				Fill in later.
